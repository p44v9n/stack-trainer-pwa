- Items
106 items
Each item has the properties:
card, position, which-being-asked, correct-ans-needed, times-seen, times-ans-correctly
Card is made up of suit and value

- Algo
Every item has correct-ans-needed = 3 at start
Unseen is in stack order i.e. pos1, pos2, pos3, 4c, 2h, 7d, pos4, pos5, pos6, 3c, 5h, etc.
If queue is < 7, add from top of unseen to make it 7
If queue is empty & unseen is empty, move mastered into unseen
When item answered correctly, decrement correct-ans-needed by 1
If correct-ans-needed becomes 0, move to mastered bucket
When item answered incorrectly, increment correct-ans-needed by 3 and put at back of queue


- Additions
Mental maths of subtracting 52 from numbers
Neighbouring cards


- Stats
Worst card (return card of item that has lowest of times-seen - times-ans-correctly)
Best card (return card of item that has highest of times-ans-correctly)
