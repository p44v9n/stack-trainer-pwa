# Stack Trainer PWA

A PWA for memorising the order of a deck of cards (a 'stack').

This app is a memory game for memorising the order of a deck of cards, using an algorithm designed for effective learning.

It's a PWA, meaning that it is lightweight, works cross-device, and should be install-able and work offline on the latest versions of iOS and Android.

My aim with coding this is to use as little code as possible that I don't understand. This means coding a lot of it in vanilla CSS, HTML and JS, and only using additional libraries where necessary.

The app also has no backend; state is stored only locally, using the HTML5 localStorage object. The benefits of this are speed, maintainability, reliability, and not having to worry about data protection. The downside is being unable to sync progress.
